The easiest way to start compressing your WordPress images in 3 easy steps. 

= How does Octify compare to other image compression plugins such as Smush, Imagify, TinyPNG etc? =

Octify has the best compression rates, more features, support 24/7, affordable one time plans with no lock-in. No pricey recurring payments and is well the best! 

= Can I use the same API key on all my web sites? = 

You sure can! As long as the API key has space available, you can use it on as many websites you want. No awkward lock-ins here. 

= Can I use the plugin for free? = 

You can! We offer 250 free image optimization  out the box. 50MB which is approx 250 images. Once this quota is used, you’d need to purchase an affordable quota add-on from just $2.99 for 5000 images. 

= Can I optimize images automatically on upload? = 

Yep, Octify is a 100% seamless WordPress Image Compression plugin. Don’t like a ton of confusing options? Neither do we. Just set it and forget it, Octify will work its magic. 

= Can I optimize my existing images? =

You probably guessed it by now, but yep you can! Octify includes a simple one click bulk image compression option. Just click the button and watch those images get compressed. Or close the page and continue with whatever you want, as unlike other image compression plugins we don’t require you to even keep your site open!

= Can I restore images? = 

Indeed. Restoring images is an important option for any image compression plugins, that’s why we made it an integral part of our plugin. Just enable the backup option and then one click restore any image. 

= What types of image formats can be optimzed? =

Currently Octify supports the JPG Compression, PNG Compression and GIF Compression with more formats coming in the near future!

= Do you have one time plans? =

We only have one time plans. We don’t believe in costly lock in auto recurring plans for discounts. That’s why we just made our plans affordable for everyone. A one time payment of just $2.99 gets you 5000 images compressed. Not bad eh? 

= What happens to my original images? = 

Your existing image are replaced with the optimized images. If you toggle the backup option, your originals are then saved in a separate folder and can be restored with one click. 

= How does the plugin actually work? = 

The light weight plugin sends the original images to our sever less environment where the compression is started, compress by our magicans in the sky. Then piped back to your WordPress site in less than a second. And they said Magic wasn’t real. 

= Do you use my server for optimising images? = 

We don’t! We use our own state of the art server less systems powered by the AWS ecosystem. This allows our light weight plugin to have no impact on your server load and ensures the best reliability possible. 

= What payment methods do you accept? =

We accept payments by PayPal and Credit/Debit card. 

= Why should I use a WordPress Image compression plugin and not an offline tool? =

Simply put, because Octify is perfectly optimized to handle your images. With the capability to optimize hundreds of thousands of images with no queue. We not only offer the best compression for JPEG, PNG and GIF. But also save you time. Just install, set it and forget it. 

= Does optimising images affect my ALT tags? =

No. Octify only optimizes images. It doesn’t affect anything else. 

= If I decide to stop using Octify will my images remain optimized? = 
 
Of course! Once the images have been optimized, they will remain optimized unless you choose to restore them. But with a plugin as perfect as this, why you would do that? :)

= Do I pay monthly or one time? =

One time! No restrictions, lock-ins or weird back room deals. Just purchase a quota add-on and get compressing!

= Does Octify work on a localhost installation? =

Regretfully not, but have no fear! Once you upload your website live, then just install Octify and watch the load time drop dramatically.
